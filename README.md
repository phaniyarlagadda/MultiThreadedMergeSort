MultiThreadedMergeSort
======================
Implemented merge sort sequentially and multi threaded. A test case benchmarks the gains of multi threaded merge against sequential merge sort for a large array with random numbers. The test cases also comprise of other functional check test cases to verify both implementataions. TestNG with dataprovider approach is used.
